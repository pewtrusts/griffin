This is\nuseful for example for visualising an amount between two points in\ntime or in a certain sector of a polar chart.\n\nSince Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric,\nwhere 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the\nprevious, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the\ntextual options, numeric point placement options won't affect axis\npadding.\n\nNote that pointPlacement needs a [pointRange](#plotOptions.series.pointRange) to work. For column series this is\ncomputed, but for line-type series it needs to be set.\n\nFor the `xrange` series type and gantt charts, if the Y axis is a\ncategory axis, the `pointPlacement` applies to the Y axis rather than\nthe (typically datetime) X axis.\n\nDefaults to `undefined` in cartesian charts, `\"between\"` in polar\ncharts.","see":["[xAxis.tickmarkPlacement](#xAxis.tickmarkPlacement)"],"sample":{"value":"maps/plotoptions/heatmap-pointplacement/\n        Placement in heatmap","products":["highcharts","highstock"]},"samples":[{"name":"Between in a column chart","value":"highcharts/plotoptions/series-pointplacement-between/","products":["highcharts","highstock"]},{"name":"Numeric placement for custom layout","value":"highcharts/plotoptions/series-pointplacement-numeric/","products":["highcharts","highstock"]},{"name":"Placement in heatmap","value":"maps/plotoptions/heatmap-pointplacement/","products":["highcharts","highstock"]}],"type":{"names":["string","number"]},"since":"2.3.0","products":["highcharts","highstock","gantt"]},"meta":{"filename":"highcharts/js/parts/Series.js","line":844,"lineEnd":884},"children":{}},"pointRange":{"doclet":{"description":"The width of each point on the x axis.
